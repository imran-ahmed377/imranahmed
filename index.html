					</h3>
					<p>
						Natural Language Processing (NLP) models often inherit racial biases present in textual data. By
						capturing semantic relationships with text, this research investigates the use of Graph Neural
						Networks (GNNs) to address racial bias in language understanding. Our approach shows how GNNs
						can be used to mitigate bias and fairly represent minority groups in NLP tasks.

						The stock market's unpredictability and complexity make predicting stock prices challenging.
						Despite this, financial experts use algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning, to
						identify patterns. This research compares traditional technical analysis models (SMA and EMA)
						with deep learning (LSTM) for predicting stock closing prices.

					<h3>
						Research Project: Bangla Handwritten Digit Classification Using Raw Image Data
					</h3>
					<p>
						In this project, the main focus was to classify Bangla handwritten digits from raw image data.
						To accomplish this project, a dataset has been made of raw images and a convolutional neural
						network is also constructed to classify the images. An Alexnet approach (mean value subtraction)
						was used to normalize the raw images.

						chat, distinguished by its simplicity and accessibility to the users who do not wish to take the
						time to install and learn to use specialized chat software. It is an application which will help
						to communicate with friend using internet. Users have to register and obtain credentials to
						login into the application.

						The system consists of various components: users, drivers, bus companies, GPS, and QR codes.
						Users create accounts to search for buses, view routes, stops, and costs, and track buses via
						real-time GPS on Google Maps. Drivers and bus companies also have accounts, enabling them to
						manage routes, costs, and notices. QR codes on buses provide detailed information, while the app
						facilitates communication and feedback between passengers, drivers, and bus companies, ensuring
						a seamless experience.

						requirements of the project. This system is intended to enable administrators, managers, and
						employees to manage and update relevant database information across various fields.
						Additionally, the administrator will have the authority to add or remove employee information as
						required.

					<h3>
						Academic Report: Less Skilled People in Internet Service Providing in Bangladesh
					</h3>
					<p>
						The purpose of this report is to present a solution to remove the internet connectivity problem
						in broadband internet in Bangladesh. To solve this problem, internet service provider (ISP)
						should open their training programs for their employees. Some government organizations can also
						take some initiative to remove this problem. A survey has been conducted to collect users'
						opinions from broadband internet users. After analyzing the collected data, it is found that
						most broadband users are suffering from internet connectivity problem and agrees with the
						proposed solutions.
